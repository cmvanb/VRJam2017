    Can I use your tutorial code for commercial projects?

    Go ahead! You're free to build on the tutorial code however you want, using it for any purpose. You don't need to credit me, but that sure is appreciated!

    Make no mistake, the route from these tutorials to a viable commercial product is a long one.
